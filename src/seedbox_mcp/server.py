        Either query or at least one attribute filter must be provided. They can be combined.

        types values (list): movie, series, plex. Defaults to all three.
          Narrow types to reduce noise: use ["movie"] for Radarr operations, ["series"] for
          Sonarr operations, ["plex"] for Plex-only queries.

        include_external_lookup: set to false when locating an existing item for delete, research,
          or queue operations — those workflows only need items already in Radarr/Sonarr.
          External lookup is only needed when adding new content not yet in the library.

        Attribute filters:
          director, actor, country — matched via Plex only (Radarr/Sonarr lack these fields).
            When any of these are set, Plex is searched automatically even if not in types.
            Plex requires the full name exactly (e.g. "Akira Kurosawa", not "Kurosawa").
            The existing Radarr/Sonarr library is suppressed when one of these is set (it
            can't filter on crew), but external lookup still runs on the query — those
            results are NOT crew-filtered, and a warning says so. Combine a title query
            with a crew filter to keep getting addable candidates.
          year — matched via every source, including external lookup (use it to pin down
            the right release when adding, e.g. query="Air Force One", year=1997).
          genre, language — matched via the existing Radarr/Sonarr library and Plex, but
            NOT applied to external lookup results.
            language matches originalLanguage in Radarr and audioLanguage in Plex (e.g. "Japanese").
            genre is a substring match (e.g. "Drama" matches "Drama", "Drama/Thriller").

        A query always drives external lookup (when include_external_lookup is true);
        attribute filters refine results, they no longer disable it.

        Each candidate includes match_type and safe_for_action. Act automatically on candidates only
        where safe_for_action is true (exact title match, plus year match if a year was supplied in
        the query). For everything else, present candidates to the user and ask for disambiguation
        before any destructive call.
